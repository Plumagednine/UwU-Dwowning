Sean: Daniel we need to make the code more mobile friendly. I opened the website on my Galaxy S9 and it was slow and laggy.
Sean: Daniel thanks for trying we will work on it tomorrow. Just responded using README or if you would prefer to text my number is +17812908862. Also can you make the UwU moving images bounce off of each other. Finally leave the .mp3 file i. GitHub just in case i have time to work on it.
